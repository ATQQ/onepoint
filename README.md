Onepoint is an open-source AI assistant based on Electron, designed to create the ultimate desktop productivity tool. Its initial goal was to develop a smart floating window similar to Apple's intelligent assistant that does not take up desktop space or system performance and can be quickly accessed through global hotkeys for user convenience.

With ChatGPT technology, users can continuously train onepoint to generate and reconstruct content with greater accuracy (onpoint), thereby improving efficiency. Onepoint currently supports various editing scenarios such as VSCode, Pages, Microsoft Word, Email etc, as well as reading scenarios like Safari and Chrome, achieving true full-scene intelligent coverage.

- ü§ñÔ∏è Personalized service, providing users with tuning mechanisms to customize their personal intelligent assistants.
- üîß Efficient output, not to replace certain tools but to complement and enhance the capabilities of existing editors.
- üìñ Reading assistance, summarizing and organizing reading scenarios to improve the speed of information acquisition.
- üéà Creative play, providing plugin mechanisms as an entry point to meet various scenarios and providing an NFT ecosystem with a harmonious technical community atmosphere.
